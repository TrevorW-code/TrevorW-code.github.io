  <h1>Analysis</h1>
  <p>When it comes to cryptocurrencies, there is not one more interesting than Dogecoin. Popularized by Elon Musk and further explored by Tick Tock, the explosion of trading cryptocurrencies has recently moved to this meme of a currency. Cryptocurrencies, based on blockchain, were initially explored by Bitcoin developer ____, whose real identity remains unknown to this day. Dogecoin, based on Litecoin, another cryptocurrency developed in 2011, follows a similar format of blockchain to communicate with a decentralized ledger, recording all transactions. While there are many different crypto currencies, the historical price of litecoin reflects a similar growth graph to that of dogecoin.</p>
  <p>Right away, looking at Figure 1 and comparing it to Figure 2, they have very similar trends. Although there are a few notable differences (like the rise and fall of Dogecoin in 2017 whereas Litecoin only increased), the graphs are notably the same. The main difference here is the price. Looking at Dogecoin, we can see that entire coins are available for fractions of a cent, whereas for Litecoins, it is significantly more expensive than that (costing several dollars, often more than 20).</p>
  <p>Next, we can look at the graphs below, where we see the transaction volume. According to Law, “Transaction Volume means the total number of Transactions processed from, to or through the Services and Platform by Provider during any applicable period”. Essentially, this is the number of transactions that happened from, to or through dogecoin and litecoin, as pictured above. There is a much more obvious difference here, as not only are the graphs very different, the amount of USD involved is very different also.</p>
  <p>When looking at the data for Dogecoin, we see that there are multiple spikes in transactions, going from early 2017 and consistently after that. However, looking at Litecoin, we really see one major spike at the beginning of 2018. Interestingly, we see that the spikes in Dogecoin have much less USD involved, although there are several different spikes. However, looking at the single spike for Litecoin, we see the currency reach almost 12 billion USD. This is likely due to the fact that Dogecoins sell for a fraction of what Litecoins sell for.</p>
  <p>Cryptocurrencies involve a lot of math. Whether it is the blockchain that is used to keep track of transactions, or miners are using lots of computational resources to arrive at the next block, it is without a doubt a very complicated procedure. However, many cryptocurrencies follow a similar route. None of these crypto currencies are as similar as Litecoin and Dogecoin. Through empirical data on historical prices and volume data, we can see that these two currencies, although the volume differs, reflect similar price trends, even if at different price points.</p>
