<p>Recently, there has been a lot of controversy over shares in a few specific stocks. The issue involved Robinhood, an app that allows users to share and trade stock for free. While the “free” part itself is debatable, the issue at hand is far worse. On ___, Robinhood made trading stocks like AMC and Gamestop impossible, at least to buy. While this action was made under the pretense that Robinhood was worried for its security (i.e. safe stock trades), others believe that Robinhood may be acting in the interest of the hedge funds that are suffering from the high volatility of these stocks. Because “traditional analysts” made claims that some stocks were “clunkers”, users on the subreddit WallStreetBets came together to raise the prices of the stocks claimed to fail. This forced hedge funds that had already made decisions to sell the stock to re-buy into the stock, causing them massive losses. As a result, Robinhood’s move to stop allowing users to buy the stock upset the market and many people. Although Robinhood is within its legal limits to stop the transaction of certain stocks, their decision isn’t right to do so. However, it may be their only option.
</p>
<p>My first thought as an information scientist is that this is very unusual for the stock market. From a data standpoint, independent investors often are not equipped with the same knowledge and tools that a lot of institutional investors have. Institutional investors use their fiscal expertise to make predictions on stocks, which will succeed and which will fail, while using algorithms to quantify and calculate the exact numbers. Ironically, this specific situation is a lot like the actual Robinhood, where people without these tools are getting a chance at earning real money. It’s anybody's guess for how long these stocks will stay inflated, but it’s definitely putting the pressure on.
</p>
<p>In terms of security, I think there may be a small concern for Robinhood. While it is their fault for not having enough servers to be able to trade, there is definitely some validity to trying to protect the security of the trades. In addition to this, E-traders like Robinhood have to meet the many regulations on trading that every other Institutional Trader has to meet.  The DTCC, one of the many stages of stock trading, has a fee for trading called collateral, that is there to reduce the risk of a bad trade. All of this came into play when looking at the Robinhood situation.
</p>
<p>“And those are the reasons the DTCC asked brokers for more collateral for each such trade. The clearing house didn’t want to be caught with brokers not having the funds they needed to settle. Therefore, Robinhood and others restricted buying on these highflying stocks until it could come up with enough cash to pay collateral. Robinhood allowed users to sell the stocks because the selling broker puts up the shares as collateral, not cash.” (Barrons, Why Did Robinhood Stop GameStop Trading? Everything to Know.)</p>
<p>Once again, from a data standpoint, the complicated algorithm that the DTCC uses to ensure that it is safe as the middleman adds a lot of data friction. This is slowing down the process of the inflation of trading. While it may not be right, it honestly seems that this is the only thing they can do, until they make up the money.</p>
